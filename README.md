Duel Arena plugin to scam people. Pioneered by ScamYouDown (MoeYouDown)

The plugin is in a broken state and will not be fixed. It is going to remain broken as the duel arena is going away.

Special thanks to Moe You Down for publishing to the world that this scam was possible. Thanks to Don Crypto and his developer for writing shitty code that was easy to spot.

# Proof section
The proof is in these two pictures.
The first is a normal odds whip v whip.

The second is whip v whip but slightly different.

**The second picture has a different size scroll bar which means settings were different.** The stake screen window is exactly the same size whether you are on resizable or on fixed mode. Moe was streaming in fixed mode for what it is worth.

## Here is the stakes options as screenshots.

This is the previous stake that was a whip stake, and you can see the previous options had a green checkmark

Here is the next stake where the same whip settings were set, and the green check mark is gone, which exposes that they are modifying the client to hide the scam when they challenge "302 Hustler"

# Special notes
Nothing I have written here is a lie. It was only ever created for educational purposes. It was never shownd, bought or sold to anybody. Anybody claiming otherwise is wrong. 

# Special thanks
Special thanks to Crumb and his attempts to enlighten the world that these plugins do exist. (Not just this one, but the one Moe used, the one Elite Ranks uses and the ones that Stella and other debt streamers use to funnel hundreds of billions of gold away from the community.
